# mydotfiles
My system dot files.

dotupdater.py - This is the smart updater for your dot files.  It does a diff between
	your existing dot files and mydotfiles.  It then allows you to choose what
	to overwrite. Or you can just exit with no changes. 

installer.sh - This is the dumb Installer.  It just copies everything in mydotfiles to 
	your home directory. Or just exit. 

diff.sh - This just runs a diff between mydotfiles and your home directory.  No
	copying is done.  Just a fast way to check all files for diffs.
