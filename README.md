# mydotfiles
My system dot files.

dotme.py - This is the smart updater for your dot files.  It does a diff between
	your existing dot files and mydotfiles.  In case of mismatch it allows you to choose what
	to overwrite. Or you can just exit with no changes.

diff.sh - This just runs a diff between mydotfiles and your home directory.  No
	copying is done.  Just a fast way to check all files for diffs.

colors.py - A Library used to add ANSI color sequences to text.
